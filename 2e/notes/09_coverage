| CHAPTER 9 - COVERAGE                                                |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Using 'coverage.py' with pytest-cov

    - 'coverage.py' is the preferred Python coverage tool.  'pytest-cov' is a popular pytest plugin 
        that makes the command line a little shorter.


    - First, we'll need to install the 2 packages:

        $ pip install coverage
        $ pip install pytest-cov


    - Then, we can run pytest with the '--cov' flag and a coverage report will be included at the end of
        the results.

        $ pytest --cov=cards ch7


    - We can also just run coverage by itself:

        $ coverage run --source=cards -m pytest ch7
        $ coverage report


    - Note that since we're running the tests on an installed package, we'll add a coverage config
        setting to specify that the installed package and local directory are the same.

        # .coveragerc
        ---------------------------
        [paths]
        source =
            cards_proj/src/cards
            */site-packages/cards


    - We can see which lines of each file are missing code coverage with:

        # Pytest version
        $ pytest --cov=cards --cov-report=term-missing ch7

        # Coverage version
        $ coverage report --show-missing



- Generating HTML reports

    - We can generate HTML reports to view coverage data in more detail.

        # Pytest version
        $ pytest --cov=cards --cov-report=html ch7

        # Coverage version
        $ pytest --cov=cards ch7
        $ coverage html



- Advanced Coverage Options

    - We can use a 'pragma' statement to exclude a block of code from coverage:

        if __name__ == '__main__': # pragma: no cover
            main()


    - To get a coverage report for the test directory itself also:

        $ pytest --cov=cards --cov=ch7 ch7


    - To get coverage for a single directory:

        $ pytest --cov=ch9/some_code ch9/some_code/test_some_code.py


    - To get coverage for a single file:

        $ pytest --cov=single_file single_file.py
