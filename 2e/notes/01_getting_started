-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Pytest

    - Command-line tool that automatically finds tests, runs them, and reports the results
    - Use regular 'assert' statement instead of weird assertion helpers
    - Lots of 3rd party plugins
    - Can be used to run legacy 'unittest' tests



- Cards Test Application

    - Minimal task-tracking application with CLI
    - CLI interacts with rest of code via API
    - API interacts with TinyDB document database



- Running a simple test

    - First, we need to install pytest.

        $ pip install pytest


    - Then, we can add a test file.

        test_one.py
        ---------------------
        def test_passing():
            assert (1, 2, 3) == (1, 2, 3)


    - And we can run the test.

        # Run tests
        $ pytest test_one.py

        # Run tests with verbose output
        $ pytest -v test_one.py

        # Run a single test
        $ pytest -v tasks/test_one.py::test_passing



- Test Discovery

    The part of pytest execution where it finds tests to run is called 'test discovery.'  To
      keep tests discoverable by pytest:

      1. Test files should be named 'test_<something>.py' or '<something>_test.py'
      2. Test methods and functions should be named 'test_<something>'
      3. Test classes should be named Test<Something>



- pytest Options

    # --collect-only lists tests that will be run without actually running them
    $ pytest --collect-only


    # -k lets you filter which tests will be run according to an expression
    $ pytest -k "asdict or defaults"

    # Run all the tests with “equality” in their name
    $ pytest -v --tb=no -k equality


    # -m lets you mark a subset of test functions to be run together
    # Test file
    import pytest
    @pytest.mark.run_these_please
    def test_member_access():
        ...

    # Run marked tests
    $ pytest -m run_these_please


    # -x will stop running on the first failed test
    pytest -x


    # --tb=no will turn stack traces from failures off
    pytest --tb=no


    # --maxfail=n will stop running after n failures
    pytest --maxfail=5


    # -s turns off output capture
    pytest -s


    # -lf only runs tests that failed on last run
    pytest --lf


    # -ff runs all the tests, with the tests that failed on the last run first
    pytest --ff


    # -v for verbose, -q for quiet
    pytest -v
    pytest -q


    # -l displays all local variable values
    pytest -l


    # --durations=0 will display how fast each of your tests run
    pytest --durations=0



- Test Outcomes

    PASSED = The test ran successfully

    FAILED = The test did not run successfully

    SKIPPED = The test was skipped because we used '@pytest.mark.skip()' or '@pytest.mark.skipif()'

    XFAIL = Was not supposed to pass, and ran and failed

    XPASSS = Test was marked with 'xfail', but it ran and passed

    ERROR = Exception happened during execution of fixture or hook function, not in test function
